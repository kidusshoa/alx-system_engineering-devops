OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is a conceptual framework for understanding and implementing computer network protocols. It divides the communication process into seven layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of communication. These layers include physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers. This model allows different systems to communicate with each other, regardless of their hardware or software differences.
